#Committee Procedures

1. Committees have a **Chairman**, a **ranking member**, and a **Chairman pro tempore** (or vice-chairman). The majority caucus selects the Chairman and the Chairman pro tempore, and the minority caucus selects the ranking member.

2. Committees also have a **secretary**. The committee should nominate and vote on a secretary at its first meeting. The secretary keeps minutes of the meeting.

3. The Chairman presides over the committee meeting. 

	Chairman responsibilities include:
	
	a. Presiding
	
	b. Creating agendas
	
	c. Creating reports
	
	d. Coordinating with the Majority Leader for setting the Senate Calendar.
	
	e. Ensuring the committee is productive.
	
4. Procedure
		
	a. Establish a quorum. A quorum for a committee is a majority of its members, one of whom must be a member of the minority party.
	
	b. Early meetings will be for writing legislation either as a whole or in smaller groups.
	
	c. Bills referred to a committee will be revised by the committee and approved for reporting to the entire Senate.
	
	d. Official revisions to a bill are called *markup*. The committee must create a **markup agenda** and distribute it to the committee members *one day* before the markup meeting.
	
		The markup agenda should include the name of the committee, the date of the meeting, a list of bills by number and title for discussion, and any reports to be considered.
		
	e. Prepare report forms for the Senate.
	
	f. Appoint **Floor Managers** for (and against) the bill.
		
##Markup procedure

Keep committee documents in the committee folder at all times. No one should remove paperwork from the folder outside of a committee meeting. Only once a bill has been reported should it be removed from the folder (and given to the President pro tempore).

1. Follow the agenda that has been distributed to the the members.
	
2. In the markup session, the committee can act on legislation in the following ways:

	- Consider the bill and vote to report it favorably.
	- Amend the bill by writing changes on an Amendment form and attaching it to the bill. (See Amending a Bill for more details. Any changes to the bill--even spelling and grammar--must be performed by an amendment.)
	- Rewrite the legislation entirely and reintroduce it to the Senate. (I.e., kill the existing bill and replace it.)
	- Reject the legislation. (Mark it "killed" or "pigeonholed" and move it to the back of the folder. Note that this is merely failing to report it to the Senate, which has the effect of killing it.)
	- Report it unfavorably (rare).
		
3. Parliamentary procedure is in order during markup.
	
4. A report to the Senate requires a majority vote, and one "yes" vote must come from a minority party member.

##Reporting

Once a committee has finished marking up legislation, a committee member should move to report the bill to the Senate. 

The committee can 

	a. report without changes,
	
	b. report with amendments,
	
	c. report with a single amendment (that replaces the bill).
	
The Floor Manager (usually a member of the majority) will present the report and the the requisite amendments. (The ranking member is usually the floor manager *against* the bill.)
	
<!--
	- Read the legislation aloud line by line.
	- Make spelling and grammar corrections.
	- Discuss the content (if the content is debatable, vote to send it to the Senate floor for debate)
	- Vote on reporting legislation
