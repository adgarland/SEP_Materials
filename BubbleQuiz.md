(For the purposes of this question, ignore neighbors who are too young to have attended college.)

If yes, how many years?

#Question 2

#Question 3

Have you ever lived for a least a year in an American community with fewer than 50,000 residents and that is not part of a metropolitan area?

(I.e., if you live in the D.C. suburbs, you should answer No.)

#Question 6

This question applies to hurts that result from using the large muscles a lot. Headaches don't count, and carpal tunnel syndrome doesn't count. Sore feet from standing for a long time does count.

#Question 9
