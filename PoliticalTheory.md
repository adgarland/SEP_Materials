#Introduction: What is Political Theory?

This lesson and handout is a very quick and shallow introduction to political theory. Its aim is for you to see the wide range of questions in this field, and to give you some terms and ideas that will help our debates be more interesting and fruitful.

Political theory is the study of concepts and categories that help explain political events and institutions. *A* political theory is one such explanation (or set of explanations). Sometimes political theory and political philosophy are used interchangably, though there are often subtle differences between the disciplines.^[The differences tend to be tied to the starting points and methods, and to a lesser degree, the subject matter.]

Political science is commonly thought of as a larger set of disciplines, of which political theory is one. Political science also seeks political explanations, but it tends to prefer more empirical methods. Political theory often deals with questions about how to make a government that empirical studies cannot answer.^[For example, we might want to know what the best form of government is. But what makes something "best"? Empirical studies cannot tell us the answer to this question.]

#Why study it?

Perhaps you think politics are interesting already. If that's the case, then you should study political theory to gain a better grasp of politics in general.

But even if you tend to dislike politics, you will still benefit from understanding the kinds of things that political theorists are interested in. You will be less susceptible to bad political arguments; you will be able to explain your own political views better; and, hopefully, you'll be a better citizen all around.

The philosopher Aristotle said that "man is by nature a political animal".^[*Politics* 1.1253a] Human beings seem to have a very powerful political instinct, and it makes sense to cultivate and refine that natural drive as well as one can.

Several of these questions (especially toward the end) are essentially different ways of asking the same thing.

#Some big questions

This section has a number of classic political theory questions. For some of them, I have included the names and definitions of famous answers.

##What is the good life?
This is a classic ethical question. There are a huge number of possible answers to it. \sidepar[right]{ \textbf{Eudamonia}: well-being, or happiness} Some classic ones include:

-----------|------------
1. Knowledge | 2. Virtue |3. Wealth | 4. Power
5. Holiness (esp. in religions) | 6. Fame (success, honor) | 7. Freedom | 8. 



##What is the state for?

-------|-----------|--------
To keep order | To preserve freedom | To enforce true religion
To enable personal prosperity | To redistribute resources | To protect against harm

: c.f. "We the People of the United States, in Order to form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defence, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity..." *Preamble to the U.S. Constitution*

##Should the state try to promote its own view of the good life? Should it have such a view?

If you say no, then you are a **political liberal**. \sidepar[right]{ \textbf{Political Liberalism}: The view that the state should be \emph{neutral} about the good life.} There isn't a single term for the opposite view.

##Should the state try to make people be moral?

This question is related to the previous one. If you don't think the state should promote a view of the good life, then it will be hard to see how the state could enforce a moral system without \marginpar[right]{ \begin{flushleft}\scriptsize\textbf{Perfectionism}: A moral theory that values the cultivation of human nature. \end{flushleft}} promoting that system.

However, **classical republicanism** \marginpar[right]{ \begin{flushleft}\scriptsize\textbf{Republicanism}: political liberty is independence from arbitrary power. \end{flushleft}} commonly argues that cultivating good citizens is a primary purpose of the state, and that requires enforcing (or at least promoting) certain kinds of morality. For theories that treat political excellence as a virtue, something similar will be true. Being morally good is bound up with being politically engaged.^[Note that this is a controversial interpretation of a very diverse and long-standing political tradition. See <http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/republicanism/> for a long and detailed treatment of this question.] The idea here is that being immoral is a way of being unfree, since moral virtue is tied up with other virtues (excellences) that human beings can have.

The contrast to republicanism is **liberalism**. \marginpar[right]{ \begin{flushleft}\scriptsize\textbf{Liberalism}: Political liberty is the greatest (political) good. \end{flushleft}} Liberalism thinks that the best kind of government maximizes liberty, even if liberty lets people do things that are bad for them. Liberals think that any kind of law or policy is a kind of interference, and thus reduces overall liberty. This view does not mean that we shouldn't have laws; it merely makes those laws hard to justify.

##Should the state do anything more than protect citizens against crime and attack? If so, what should it do?

If you say no--you think the state should just protect against foreign aggression and against \sidepar{ \textbf{Libertarianism}: the government should not coerce behavior any more than it absolutely must.}crimes--then you are a **libertarian**.^["Libertarian" here is being used in the philosophical sense. The philosophical view called libertarianism also says a lot about *property*, and bases much of its political principles on the notion of *consent*.] "Liberty" in this case is *negative* liberty--the right to be left alone. The government that reflects this view is sometimes called a "minimal state."

There is a different notion of liberty that some theorists defend. This is a *positive* liberty. Under this view, liberty is more than absence of coercion. Liberty is about self-determination or *autonomy*. \sidepar{ \textbf{Autonomy}: literally, \emph{self rule}; one's actions are truly one's \emph{own}.} An addict is not free in this sense. He is not coerced by the government to continue his addiction, but he is still subject to the addiction's power. Similarly, an uneducated or unintelligent person is not really free. More pointedly, someone who is unduly swayed by advertising or demagoguery is not free in this sense.

A more robust form of liberty is *republican* liberty. Under this view--which is connected with classical republicanism--liberty is the absence of the *possibility* of being coerced or dominated.^[These three paragraphs are summaries of the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy article on Liberalism: <http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/liberalism/>]

If you think that the state should be more than *minimal* in the sense above, then there is a further question about kinds of things the government can do. Self-determination requires a certain degree of education, for instance. Often we need a kind of social minimum (e.g. welfare) to ensure that some people are not coerced indirectly by their poverty. 

There are other non-liberal theories of government. One prominent alternative is the idea that government is supposed to cultivate virtue. In this case, the government might prohibit all sorts of things that have little effect except to enforce virtue. For instance, blue laws (which prohibit certain activities on Sundays) fall under this category. If these kinds of laws have an economic effect, it is probably a negative one. But perhaps they promote a certain kind of virtue that is part of a good life.


##How much freedom should the government give to its citizens? Is this question just confused? 

Why might you think that this is a confused question? Use the ideas in the previous sections to explain why this is a bad question.

##What is the best form of government? Does the form matter?

There are many different forms of government. Classifying them can be tricky, since the precise definitions that distinguish them are controversial. Sometimes labels can be misleading, so take care when you use them.

Our government is a republic. \marginpar[right]{\begin{flushleft}\scriptsize\textbf{Republic}: the government is composed of elected representatives. \end{flushleft}} Our government is also democratic, though is not a democracy. By *democratic*, we mean that the political authority rests in the citizens. But because we have a republic, that authority is administered by elected officials.[^Reps] An additional feature of our government that makes it more clearly a republic, and not a representative democracy, is the presence of a Constitution.^[Another feature that distinguishes our form from a parliamentary system (as in the United Kingdom) is that the President is both the head of state and the head of the government. In the U.K., the queen is the head of state, and the prime minister is the head of the government.]

[^Reps]: "Certainly, gentlemen, it ought to be the happiness and glory of a representative to live in the strictest union, the closest correspondence, and the most unreserved communication with his constituents. Their wishes ought to have great weight with him; their opinion, high respect; their business, unremitted attention. It is his duty to sacrifice his repose, his pleasures, his satisfactions, to theirs; and above all, ever, and in all cases, to prefer their interest to his own. But his unbiassed opinion, his mature judgment, his enlightened conscience, he ought not to sacrifice to you, to any man, or to any set of men living. These he does not derive from your pleasure; no, nor from the law and the constitution. They are a trust from Providence, for the abuse of which he is deeply answerable. Your representative owes you, not his industry only, but his judgment; and he betrays, instead of serving you, if he sacrifices it to your opinion." Edmund Burke, "Speech to the Electors of Bristol," November 3, 1774.

It is important to note that the United States is *not* a democracy. \marginpar[right]{\begin{flushleft}\scriptsize\textbf{Democracy}: the government is run directly by the people. \end{flushleft}} In a sense, this should not be a surprise. Our country is too large to conduct all of our political business by directly voting. But maybe having a democracy is bad for reasons other than mere inefficiency. Can you think of any such reasons?

Other forms of government include monarchies, oligarchies, and aristocracies. Each of these can have other features (e.g., a consitution or not) to distinguish it from others in the same group.

Aristotle was one of the first systematic political thinkers. He identified six kinds of government. They are divided into two broad categories. The first category is the virtuous, or correct, form. And the second category is the vicious, or deviant, form.
\marginpar[right]{ \begin{flushleft}\scriptsize\textbf{Monarchy}: rule by one.\\ \textbf{Aristocracy}: rule by the best.\\ \textbf{Oligarchy}: rule by the few (the rich).\\ \textbf{Polity}: rule by the "middle class". \end{flushleft} } 


------:|------------|---------
..     | Virtuous | Vicious
One Ruler | Monarchy | Tyranny
Few Rulers | Aristocracy | Oligarchy
Many Rulers | Polity | Democracy

: Aristotle's six forms of government, from *Politics* III.7

Aristotle thinks that the monarchy is the best, and then the ranking goes down the virtuous side and back up the vicious side (i.e., tyranny is the worst). Note that *democracy* ends up in the "vicious" category. Why might that be?

What is the difference between a monarchy and a tyranny?

Perhaps the form of government doesn't matter as much as the character and ability of the governors. But David Hume, a Scottish philosopher in the 1700s, argued that the forms of government that have set laws (e.g. republics) to check the activites of the government are better because they are more stable and less easy to manipulate for personal gain.
