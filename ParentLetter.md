Dear SEP families,

Welcome to the 2013 Summer Enrichment Program (SEP) here at the University of Virginia!

I'm thrilled to be one of your child's teachers this summer. I am a 3rd year Ph.D. student in the Philosophy Department at UVA. My previous education includes a master's degree in philosophy, another master's degree in math education, and a bachelor's degree in humanities. When I was in high school, I debated in the National Forensics League and then during my college years did quite a bit of debate judging. It was through one of my NFL coaches that I learned about Mock Congress. Though I debated instead of competing in the NFL's Mock Congress, my debate experience contributed to my interest in philosophy and it made me appreciate the importance and value of public policy debates.

This course is going to be a Mock Senate. Each student will be assigned to "role-play" a current U.S. Senator. As that senator, he or she will craft legislation, participate in committees, give floor speeches, and vote as that senator might. We will try to focus our debates and legislation on currently relevant issues facing the Senate. Much of the pedagogical emphasis will be on crafting persuasive arguments about live policy issues. Part of the challenge will be in defending and advocating views that the student might not personally agree with. The time limitations will prevent us from doing a lot of empirical research, so we'll be focusing on the rhetorical strategies and theoretical frameworks more than the practical details.

If you have any questions or concerns, please contact me through the SEP office: 434.924.3182 or via
email: curry-sep@virginia.edu.

Looking forward to a great class,

Andrew Garland
