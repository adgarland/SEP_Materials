#Introduction

Public deliberation is a hallmark of western democracies. Most governmental business is conducted in the open and (in principle) using terms and ideas that are accessible to ordinary citizens. This course intends in the main to give you some instruction and practice in this sort of public debate, and particularly to know how to debate and deliberate persuasively, cooperatively, respectfully, and effectively.

This handout is an instruction and reference sheet for debate speeches in the Mock Senate. It also will include some more detail than we are likely to need. This extra information is for your future reference and help.

In the actual Senate, members may take the floor at nearly any time, and speak on nearly any subject for as long as they wish. Though we will in principle adopt this rule, we will also follow the customary practice of staying on topic during debate. Speeches should be efficient and germane so that others can have a fair amount of our limited time.


#Debate Speeches

Your debate speeches should include the following elements:

1. Say whether you support or oppose the measure.
2. Give reasons for your support or opposition.
3. Benefits or problems that would come with passing the measure.

If the bill or resolution (or amendment) is poorly written or incomplete, you may say so. If you wish, you can offer an amendment to correct the flaws.

#Reasons and Arguments

Each speech should include reasons for or against a measure. Not everything that seems like a relevant consideration is actually a good reason. There are many different kinds of valid reasons in ordinary decision-making, but in public deliberation the available reasons are much more limited.

##What is a reason?

Very generally, a reason is a consideration for or against a course of action.^[Strictly speaking, this is a definition of a *practical* reason.] But usually a good reason is also going to be the sort of thing that other people might be expected to share. For instance, if someone says, "Why should I drink coffee," it seems odd to reply, "Because I like it." The fact that you like coffee gives *you* a reason to drink it, but it doesn't clearly give anyone else a reason.

In public deliberation, we prefer reasons that others might be expected to share. So a reason for drinking coffee might be, "Because it's good for you."^[Some kinds of reasons that are less clearly personal without being fully impersonal. For instance, if you say, "Because coffee tastes good," you are basing your claim on your personal states. But the form of your statement implies that your claim is objectively true---that everyone else would think that coffee tastes good as well.] 


##What kinds of reasons should you use?

There is considerable debate among political scientists and philosophers about what sorts of things can count as a legitimate public reason. Typically the debate concerns whether religious considerations can count as a reason in public deliberation.^[Often "religion" here includes any sort of comprehensive ethical system, whether it is a traditional religion or not.] 

Since you are playing a role, you should try to think about the view your senator would take on this issue. Clearly there are senators who have no problem advocating religious or quasi-religious views. However, you should take note to see whether the religious language they sometimes use is just a rhetorical strategy or a real, substantive claim.

For instance, many of the arguments used in the 1960s to combat racism had a religious tone. However, the same conclusions could be reached using non-religious claims, so the religious language might have been more of a rhetorical tool than an attempt to use religion to influence public policy.

##What makes a good argument?

Arguments have both formal and informal characteristics that determine their quality. Different kinds of arguments have different standards of quality. This section will briefly describe three different forms of reasoning and will give some standards of quality for each.

###Deductive argument
The classic form of a deductive argument is a syllogism. There are several forms of valid syllogisms, and typical errors associated with each form. Syllogisms should be **sound**. Being sound means being **valid** (i.e., in the correct form) and with **true premises**. 


A classic syllogism is this:

~~~~~~
	1. Socrates is a man.  
	2. All men are mortal.  
	3. Therefore, Socrates is mortal.  
~~~~~~

This is a valid form, and the premises are true. The form ensures that the valid premises unfailingly result in a true conclusion.

Many syllogisms are actually *conditional* syllogisms (they use if...then statements). There are two classic forms of conditional syllogisms. If A, then B; A; therefore B. And, if A, then B; not B; therefore not A. These forms come with classic errors: affirming the consequent, and denying the antecedent.

The first error could give a syllogism like this: 

~~~~~~~~~
	4. If the government bans driving, then the USA will use less gas.  
	5. The USA is using less gas.  
	6. Therefore, the government is banning driving.  
~~~~~~~~~
	
The second error could give a syllogism like this:

~~~~~~~
	7. If the Nationals don't win the pennant, then they should fire their manager.  
	8. The Nationals won the pennant.  
	9. Therefore, the Nationals should not fire their manager.  
~~~~~~~~~

These kinds of errors are very common in public deliberation. In the first case, there are many other possible explanations for lower gas usage. In the second case, the argument is not considering other reasons for firing the manager.

###Inductive argument
This kind of argument is hard to state formally. Very generally, it is an argument from the past pattern to future events. For example, "I believe that the sun will rise tomorrow because it has always risen in the past." It is hard to see how the past pattern *guarantees* that the future will be like the past. However, we use this kind of reasoning all the time.^[Indeed, even those philosophers who have showed the flaws in this reasoning have noted that we cannot make sense of the world and our actions if we do not accept that this kind of reasoning *usually* works.]

This kind of reasoning is powerful in policy debates because it allows us to look at lots of examples, discern patterns, and expect that if we do some particular thing, the same result will occur.

To combat this kind of argument, one typically needs to show that the situation in question is not like other examples in some important way. While it may be true that the weight of examples gives only partial support, it is hard to argue that *this particular case* will be the exception and not the rule.^[A common and sophisticated way to escape some of these problems requires using statistical techniques to make predictions. It is not clear that this method solves all of the problems, but it does seem to help. However, it gets very complicated very quickly, and thus will be mostly outside the scope of our debates.]

###Inference to the best explanation
This method of reasoning is perhaps the hardest to understand of the three we will consider. The general procedure goes like this: Take an event, or a collection of events, and try to determine what is the most plausible explanation for those events. This kind of reasoning blends both deductive and inductive forms. 

This kind of reasoning is the stock in trade of TV mystery and detective shows. For a more mundane example, suppose you're trying to find your phone. You try to figure out what happened to it. It is logically possible that it was stolen by a chimpanzee escaped from the zoo. But that seems unlikely. It's more likely that it fell between the couch cushions. To find it, you'll try to think of plausible explanations for its disappearance.

Note that what counts as the "best" explanation (or even a "good" explanation) is not necessarily fixed. There are some considerations that we tend to prefer, but they are not decisive. In general, it is good to have a simple explanation--the chimpanzee story would require a lot of improbable events--but sometimes more complicated accounts are more accurate. But sometimes accuracy isn't as important either. You might remember your elementary school science classes. Usually the science in those lessons is very simplified, and less accurate, and for good reason. Sometimes we prefer naturalistic explanations, and especially scientific ones. But it is not necessarily true that the scientific explanation is the best one.^[For instance, in ethical questions, science seems to have very little to say.]

The way to resist this kind of explanation is to offer a better explanation--one that is simpler, covers more of the data, is more accurate, etc.

#Persuasive Strategies

This final section concerns techniques and strategies for persuading others, and particularly for objecting to a proposed policy. This is a part of the ancient art of rhetoric. 


##How to make a policy proposal

Policy proposals need several components to be effective. But generally there are two big parts: the case and the plan.

The case is the justification for proposing a policy in the first place. Usually it describes a situation that is bad in some way or other and explains what makes it bad. The easiest way to make the case is to list the harms that a current course of action (the status quo) is causing. 

For instance, suppose that you want to argue for making the school day start at 10am. You might start by showing that high school students aren't really awake until 10, that starting early means driving in the dark, which is less safe, etc.

Sometimes there are no harms in the current situation, but we must do *something*. In this case, it can help to list possible courses of action and show how the other options will have bad consequences--or at least worse consequences than your plan.

When you are making a plan, there are several components that you should try to include. Try to answer these questions:

1. What exactly is going to be done?
2. Who is going to do it (who has the authority to make it happen)?
3. How much will it cost (i.e., how much should the government appropriate for it)?
4. How will it be paid for?
5. What advantages will it have over the status quo?

There are variants of this strategy. One of the most common involves comparing the various options and selecting the best one. You don't have to say what harms the others will cause; it is enough that your plan has more and better advantages. The hard part about a case like this is that you need to make sure that you cover all of the possibilities. 

##How to object to a policy proposal

The strategies for objecting to a policy idea depend somewhat on the way in which the idea is being defended. But there are a few general strategies that work against many kinds of arguments.

1. Dispute the need for change. This is about objecting to the "case" against the status quo. You can either argue that the harms don't exist, that they are not significant, or that they are outweighed by other considerations. 

2. Dispute the details of the plan. Perhaps you can concede that *something* must be done, but that this particular plan is bad for some reason or other. In particular, you can argue that the details of the plan cannot work, perhaps because they are unconstitutional, or too difficult or expensive.^[These are just examples. There are many ways to object.] You should take care in this strategy, however, since if you concede that something must change, but dislike the proposed solution, you might be pressed to provide your own solution.

3. Offer a different plan. Instead of disputing the value of the plan, you can concede the need for change, and even concede that the proposed plan would solve the problem. But then you can argue that your plan would do an even *better* job of solving the problem. This strategy can be very effective, but it requires a pretty thorough alternative plan, which is a lot of work.

As we proceed into actual policy debates, you will have some opportunities to think about the best strategies to combat the particular plans we discuss. This list of possibilities is very general and it is not nearly exhaustive.
