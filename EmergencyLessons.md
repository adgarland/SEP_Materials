Most of the content of the class is driven by the students, and so the precise expertise needed to substitute for the class will vary. This document will give some suggestions and pointers about how to proceed. Refer to the included handouts for more content.

#Case 1
Day 1: If a sub is required on the first day of class, then, honestly, it's going to go badly. I suppose the teacher could talk about the Senate and hand out these three documents: *Student Profile*, *Party Platforms* and *Introduction*. The students can use the computer lab to research senators to go on their lists. After that research is done, ideally they'd familiarize themselves with the party platforms and start thinking about and researching some of the topics that appear.

Alternatively, if the teacher is comfortable with it, he or she could also work through the *Political Theory* handout after the *Profiles* are done.

#Case 2
Days 2-4: If a sub is required on another day in the first week, the class should be able to do a lot of their own work. They can write legislation and begin thinking about their speeches. The teacher should be prepared to help the students write plausible legislation according to their senator roles. The *Writing Legislation* handout may help. Utlimately, this would be a writing activity, so it will be useful to treat it as such. The topics are up to the students (within reason), so the teacher might need to be prepared to help with a lot of different topics.

Students should write their legislation on the *Bill* and *Resolution* forms. If the computer lab is available, it might be useful to them (and the teacher) to use it for research.

#Case 3
Days 5-9: After the 4th day, the students will be almost totally invested in the business of the Senate. Call on the majority leader to take the chair and proceed in order down the legislative calendar. Try to enforce good debate practices and parliamentary procedure. The *Order of Business*, *Debate Rules*, and *Debating* handouts will be useful. The teacher will for the most part just need to make sure that everyone behaves and stays moderately engaged. 

During debate, senator may talk quietly to each other and move around the room. However, if at any time the chair can hear an unrecognized voice, or if the senator holding the floor cannot be heard, the president should call for order and the senators should return to their seats.

If there is extra time, use it to refine debate speeches and strategies, or to draft amendments.
