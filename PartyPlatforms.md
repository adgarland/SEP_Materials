The 2012 Republican platform has a long list of policy proposals. It will give lots of ideas for writing legislation. The Democrat platform has far fewer proposals. It reads like an argument in favor of voting for Democrats. This is a perfectly good thing to do with a party platform, but it means that you will need to do further research in order to come up with substantive policy ideas. The Republican model has a lot of policy ideas, but some of them are quite bold and controversial, so it might not be as easy to defend proposed legislation if it appears to be a core plank of the broader theme.

#Ideological Cheat Sheet

This is a rough sketch of the ideological positions of each party on a number of issues. It is necessarily over-simplified, and your Senator might not actually agree with his or her party on all of the issues. It also tends to show points on which the parties disagree, rather than the points on which they agree. It also avoids points on which one or both parties lacks a clear policy position.

: Policy ideas

#Republicans (GOP)^[<http://www.gop.com/2012-republican-platform_home/>]

##Economic

###Taxes

- Make taxes "simple, transparent, flatter, and fair."
    - Extend "Bush tax cuts"
    - Reduce marginal tax rates^[Marginal tax rates are the rate on the next dollar of income. So a 10% marginal tax rate above $100,000 would mean that ever dollar *over* $100,000 would be taxed 10%, regardless of the rate for the first $100,000.] by 20% while keeping revenue the same
    - Eliminate taxes on interest, dividends, and capital gains for lower and middle-income taxpayers

- Change taxes for businesses
    - Reduce the corporate tax rate
    - Make a permanent research and development tax credit
    - Repeal corporate AMT
    - Switch to territorial taxation^[This means that corporate profits generated in other countries (and with taxes paid in other countries) would not be retaxed when returned to the U.S.. The thought is that the non-territorial system encourages businesses to avoid taxes by putting their corporate offices in other countries.]
    
- Religious and charitable organizations should be exempt from taxes, and contributions to them should be tax-deductible.
- Any restructuring of the tax system must include a repeal of the 16th Amendment.^[Which instituted the federal income tax.]

- Cap spending at the historical average of the percent of GDP.^[Gross Domestic Product]

- Permit more religious expression in public life.
- Oppose campaign finance regulations.
- Oppose speech codes (especially in schools, etc.).

- Support property rights against the government.^[The GOP is especially thinking of *Kelo vs. New London*, which pretty substantially expanded eminent domain powers.]
- Oppose abortion, euthanasia, and assisted suicide.^[N.B. These are topics that we will not treat in our class.]
- Oppose the influence of foreign law and policy, as well as foreign organizations (e.g., the U.N.)
