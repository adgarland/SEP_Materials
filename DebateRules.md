#Quorum

A quorum is a simple majority of senators. However, in practice, the Senate floor often has less than half of the senators on it. By custom, a quorum is assumed unless a senator asks to verify that the quorum is present. This is a "quorum call." A senator says, *"Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum."* Business is suspended until half of the senators are in the room.

#Debate Rules

There are two very different forms of debate rules in the Senate. The Standing Rules of the Senate provide instruction for normal business. However, in practice, these rules are often set aside by unanimous consent to expedite the legislative process. 

##Unanimous Consent

Because the rules may be suspended only by unanimous consent, individual senators have a lot of influence over the activities of the Senate. In practice, senators wishing to withhold their consent will notify their party leader so that measures which do have unanimous consent can proceed accordingly. 

Nearly any rule of the Senate may be suspended by unanimous consent. Senators may also make non-debatable motions to suspend particular rules.^[Non-debatable means that the Senate will vote on the motion immediately and without debate.]

Often, unanimous consent agreements actually *restrict* the ordinary powers of senators. For example, the Senate may adopt a unanimous consent agreement (typically brokered between the party leaders) to limit debate in particular ways, to restrict amendments to a measure, or to move a measure up on the calendar.

##Standing Rules

1. The Senate may not introduce money-raising bills. It may debate such bills if they are sent over by the House.

2. Debate is not limited except by [unanimous consent](#unanimous-consent) or by [cloture](#filibusters-and-cloture).

3. Senators may request to speak by standing. The chair will recognize the first senator to stand, with preference for the party leaders when there is more than one senator who stands at a time.

4. A senator may not speak more than **twice** on a measure. A measure is a bill or amendment under consideration. Senators may speak twice on the bill and twice on each amendment to it.

5. Once recognized by the chair, a senator may speak for as long as he wishes on any subject. He may yield for questions (which does not yield the floor) or for other business (which does yield the floor).

	A senator who wishes to ask the current speaker a question should stand and address the chair: *"Mr. President, will the speaker yield for a question?"* The speaker may answer, *"Mr. President, the speaker will yield."* Or, *"Mr. President, the speaker will not yield."*
	
6. After a bill or resolution has been debated and there is no objection to ending debate (e.g., ending debate has unanimous consent), a senator should move to vote.

	*"Mr. President, I move that S._____ entitled ______________ be *engrossed*."*
	
	This motion requires a second, and then the bill or resolution comes to a vote. The vote should be either a standing vote or a roll call vote.

An "engrossed" bill has its form finalized and is sent to the printer. Once it has returned to the Senate, a formal vote (by roll call) is taken to pass the bill or resolution. If it passes, it is sent to the House and is now called an *Act*.
	
7. Once a bill or resolution passes or fails to pass, the following procedure should occur:

	a. A member of the majority party calls for "reconsideration of the bill." After a second, another member stands and says,
	b. *"I move that we table the motion to reconsider."* This also requires a second.
	c. A vote is taken immediately on this motion to reconsider. If the motion to table succeeds, the bill may not be taken up again by the Senate during the session.^[Note that the motion to table would be presumed to succeed, since senators who voted for the bill would likely also vote to not reconsider it.]

##Filibusters and Cloture

Under the Rules of the Senate, and senator may speak on any subject for as long as he wishes at nearly any time. Filibusters are a way to delay a measure in an attempt to influence its passage. 

###Filibusters

There are two basic ways to filibuster a bill. First, introduce an endless series of amendments. The amendments do not have to be germane (i.e. about the bill that its under consideration). You must follow amendment procedures to do this. The second way to filibuster is to gain the floor and speak indefinitely on any subject. (Ideally, during this time other senators should be privately persuading each other to vote for or against the bill.)

During a filibuster senators may leave the floor and work on other business (quietly). 

###Cloture
Cloture is a way to end a filibuster. Three senators must submit a petition to the President to end debate. In twenty minutes (in the real Senate it is two days), a vote is taken on this petition. If 3/5 (11) of the Senators agree to the petition, then cloture is invoked. Each senator gets 1 minute of debate time before a vote is taken on the measure.


#Amendments

Amendments to a bill or resolution may be made by any senator. The senator should be recognized by the chair and should present the amendment at the beginning of his or her speech. Use the amendment form to write the text of the amendment. Remember that the exact wording of the amendment is what is being considered.

Committees are not allows to present amendments that change the substance of the bill on matters outside of the committee's jurisdiction.

Amendments that are presented follow the ordinary procedure for motions. The motion must be considered until voted on or tabled.
