#Party Caucuses

The caucus is a meeting of the party to choose officers and other leadership, and to establish a strategy for passing legislation.

We will have a longer caucus session on the first Tuesday. The following things need to occur in that session:

1. Choose committee chairmen and ranking members. (Democrats should also choose vice chairmen for each committee.) 

2. Assign members to each committee. Each senator (except the party leaders) should be on two committees.

3. Review the party platform (what you want to try to accomplish as a party, and how members should vote on particular issues).

4. Individual senators should be given a chance to suggest planks of the platform that represent their state's interests.

*5. The Democratic caucus may also wish to create a calendar for presiding over the Senate.*

The first item on the list should take less than 10 minutes.

After the committees are selected, use the remaining time to decide as a party what kinds of legislation you want to propose. 

The party leaders should preside over the caucus meetings (i.e. Mr. Reid and Mr. McConnell).

###Other caucus times
There are no other formally scheduled caucus meetings. The party leaders may, with the approval of the president pro tempore, schedule some additional caucus time to coordinate debate and committee action.
