#Welcome!

#What you should learn

There are several general themes that we will focus on during these two weeks. Here is a brief (incomplete) list of things that I hope you know by the end of our time together:

\begin{multicols}{2}
\begin{enumerate}
\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
\item{What the Senate does}
\item{Basic parliamentary procedure}
\item{Basic political theory}
\item{How to write a persuasive speech}
\item{How to write a policy plan}
\item{How to debate about public policy}
\item{Basic ideological positions of both U.S. political parties}
\end{enumerate}
\end{multicols}

#How this class will work

You will be assigned a role to play. I will try to assign you to play a senator of your choosing. Once your role is assigned, you will be expected to play that role throughout the rest of our Senate activities.

We will try to model the actual working of the U.S. Senate. Because of our time and size constraints, the model will have to be simplified somewhat. But there should be enough similarity to give you a good sense of how the Senate actually works.

I have a lot of information for you, and it will come very fast. But once we get into Senate activities, most of our time will be taken up by those activities and not my formal instruction.


#Expectations

Here is a list of my primary expectations for you:

1. Participate
2. Be respectful (both of others' views and their desire to learn)
3. Play your role as well as you can
4. Write (or coauthor) at least one piece of legislation
5. Give at least two speeches on the floor


#Schedule

See the calendar handout.

#Talking to me

I am very open to suggestions about doing things differently. If you have an idea, please come talk to me about it.

Once we are in the writing and debating stage, I expect there will be time for you to get personalized help from me about your writing and speaking. I will provide what help I can, and you should feel free to ask for it.

If something is not going well (whatever it is), please talk to me about it as soon as you can.
