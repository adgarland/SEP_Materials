#Introduction

Well-crafted legislation makes for good policy; for our purposes, it makes for good debate. This handout covers some basic advice and strategies for writing legislation for our Mock Senate. Some of the points are fairly specific to our activities, but many of the general themes will serve you well anytime you need to write persuasively.



#What to Write About

Remember that you are playing a role. You should plan to write legislation about things that your senator would care about. Topics relevant to your state are always a good place to start. Furthermore, your party leaders might have a particular agenda that they wish to pursue, and they might ask you to write legislation to pursue the party's goals. Once you have done some research about your senator, you should have a pretty good idea about what kinds of things are important to him or her. Other valid topics for legislation are issues that concern the entire nation. The senate in particular tends to take up that sort of work.

#General Advice and Strategies

Usually when you are writing a persuasive argument, the most important part is a strong, clear thesis. Legislation usually doesn't have an ordinary thesis statement. But it does have a title and a "purpose statement." These statements are the best place to say clearly what the bill or resolution is supposed to accomplish. That will be what you need to argue for. A good purpose statement (i.e. thesis) will help focus your legislation and will help you see what you need to do to justify it.

The next step in writing legislation is clarifying key terms. Bills often have a section devoted to this step (see below). You will help keep the debate on point if you can define the key terms up front. Take special care to notice if you are using ordinary words in special ways. When possible, use the simplest adequate terms.^[Legislation is usually written by lawyers and for lawyers, and as such, it tends to be very technical and dense. I would like you to avoid this habit for our class.]

It is usually helpful when writing legislation to think about how you would argue for it. However, the argument usually doesn't actually appear in the legislation (for a partial exception, see the section below). It is best to keep the legislation as clean and straightforward as possible. Be sure that you are clear enough to not have to spend debate time explaining parts of the plan, but don't waste space by arguing for the plan in the legislation. Remember that the legislation is about *doing* something, not arguing for something.^[See the handout about debating for more on defending your ideas.]

#Writing Bills

Bills authorize government activities, amend existing laws, establish or alter federal agencies, appropriate money, and (in the House) raise revenue.^[Richard S. Beth, "Bills and Resolutions: Examples of How Each Kind is Used," *Congressional Research Service*, 2 December 2010. <http://assets.opencrs.com/rpts/98-706_20101202.pdf>]

Bills typically follow a detailed outline. The precise form of the outline tends to vary; extremely long bills often have many outline levels. For our purposes, we will try to keep them simple enough to need only section headings.^[See the handout in your packet with a model for the relevant sections.]

There are several standard sections in a bill:

1. A Preamble, that gives the title and purpose of the bill.

2. A section for definitions of key terms.

3. An entity tasked with enforcing the bill and a mechanism by which they many do so. This section is often the longest, since it describes both what the government intends to do, and how it will do so. Then it also includes relevant enforcement information.^[Not all bills must be enforced by specifying penalties. Sometimes enforcement is actually just instructions for how to do the activity being authorized.]

4. A time frame for implementation (i.e., when does the bill go into effect, and for how long will it be valid?)

5. A clause that supersedes any previous conflicting legislation.

Often parts of the bill are vague, with the expectation that the relevant enforcement entity will make the details of the policy. For our purposes, you should be fairly explicit about the details of the plan. Even if you do not include all of the details in the bill itself, you should be prepared to show how a government entity could enforce the Act given the parameters you have set up. 


#Writing Resolutions

There are several kinds of resolutions that the Senate can consider. Most of our time will be with **joint resolutions**. Other resolution types are **concurrent resolutions** (with the House), and **simple resolutions**, which affect only the Senate itself.

Resolutions are somewhat less common and are typically used for unusual or incidental Congressional actions. The most important kind of resolution is one to amend the Constitution. Other significant purposes for *joint resolutions* are declaring war, continuing resolutions,^[These reauthorize current spending levels and priorities.] transfer of appropriation, ratifying or abrogating treaties, adjusting the Congressional calendar, approving or disapproving of executive actions,^[Congress can officially express its displeasure with something the President has done.], congratulations, condolences, and thanks, etc.

The general format of a resolution is a series of "whereas" statements followed by a "be it resolved that" statement. The resolution is the "be it resolved" statement(s), and it functions like the thesis discussed above. The "whereas" statements provide a little bit of justification and explanation for the resolution. They are not strictly necessary, but they often help interpret the resolution for debate and implementation. Whereas statements also commonly rehearse relevant history and law that would motivate the resolution.

As with the bills, it is helpful when writing resolutions to think about how one might defend them. The whereas statements will provide some of the justification, but it is probably wise to limit the statements that must be voted on to claims that would not be very controversial. You wouldn't want another senator to object to your resolution merely because he or she disagrees with a whereas statement.


##Special Resolutions

As noted above, Constitutional amendments are joint resolutions. They tend to be very simple, but they include the actual text of the amendment.

Simple resolutions help conduct the flow of business in the Senate. They are usually very straightforward, and if we need to introduce one to our session, we will discuss how to do so at that time.
