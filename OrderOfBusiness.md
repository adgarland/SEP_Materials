#First Hour

1. Declare a quorum.

2. Call for the reading of the Journal from the previous day unless disposed of by unanimous consent. 

	*"Unless there is an objection the Journal stands approved."*
	
3. Leader time: Majority and minority leaders may have *5 minutes* to address the Senate. This time typically allows the leaders to announce changes to the Calendar and other agendas.
	
4. Congressional Record 

	*"Senators may now make remarks for the Congressional Record."*
	
	This is an opportunity for senators to make brief remarks that they wish to be preserved in the official record of the Senate.
	
5. At this point it is in order to move a bill or resolution from the Calendar for immediate consideration. These stipulations apply:
	a. The motion must be approved unanimously.
	b. A motion to limit time on the debate is in order. It also requires unanimous consent.
	
6. Announce the day's committee meetings.

	*"The following committees will meet today:..."*
	
7. Receive messages from the House. (This is legislation passed by the House and sent to the Senate.)

	*"Are there any messages from the House?"*
	
	Messages may be considered immediately (by unanimous consent) or sent to committee.
	
	Messages from other part of the government are presented here as well (e.g. message from the President).
	
8. Call for reports from Standing Committees.

9. Call for introduction of new legislation.

	a. *"Senators may now introduce **Bills**."* (After the senator reads his or her bill, he or she gives it to the secretary.)
	b. *"Senators may now introduce **Joint Resolutions**."*
	c. *"Senators may now introduce **Concurrent Resolutions**."*
	d. *"Senators may now introduce **Simple Resolutions**."*
10. Call for a motion to adjourn First Hour business.

	If there is no Second Hour Business, Senators will proceed to committees.
	
11. First Hour Business should end after a specified time unless a motion to extend the time is approved by unanimous consent. The time should be specified by a Simple Resolution introduced by a Senator.

#Second Hour

1. As soon as the First Hour adjourns, the President pro tempore calls the Second Hour to order. During the Second Hour, bills are debated in Calendar order. (See **Debate Rules** for details.)

2. The President calls for consideration of bills and resolutions. They are read by number and title as they appear on the Calendar. A Senator may ask for the entire bill to be read.

3. When debate time is over, the President calls for a motion to adjourn or recess.

	If the Senate adjourns, the next day will start with First Hour business. Typically the Senate merely recessess, and a new session of First Hour Business begins as needed by unanimous consent.

#Unfinished Business

1. When a motion to adjourn interrupts debate, the bill or resolution being considered moves to the Unfinished Business list.

2. Unfinished business is considered on a day when there is extra time and is taken up in order of the list.
